The assignment was to recreate the Newsweek homepage. This was my first attempt at using Bootstrap. It took me a good while of wallowing in frustration before I understood just how helpful Bootstrap can be. Everything should be responsive as it is on Newsweek's site. 

I did run into an issue with saving the images directly from Newsweek's site. All images are currently PNGs (long story), which causes a slow page loading time. I plan to update it when I have the time.
